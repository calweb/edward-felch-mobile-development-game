Ninjas and Cats v1 2012-01-23

This Android application was built with jQuery Mobile, PhoneGap, and a lot of hacked up Javascript.

This application should be easy to deploy on different platforms since all the logic that controls the game is stored
within HTML and JavaScript.

There aren't any real plans on continuing this project since it was created for an event and as a learning exercise.

Feel free to fork and modify the source.
