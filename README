Ninjas and Cats is a demonstration app for Android that was built with jQuery Mobile, PhoneGap, and a lot of hacked up JavaScript.

All the logic for the game is stored within the JavaScript and HTML pages.

Not much else is being added to this, feel free to fork and change the code - hopefully, it can help in learning how to build a
    mobile app whose logic can easily be ported to different platforms.
