Gameplay:
    Don't scramble characters that are being displayed right now
    Don't let multiple characters sit on each other 64 width/height
    Animation of explosion when character is disappearing doesn't always show... when it starts to fade out





Make a second enemySound and alternate between the two, maybe handle double clicking enemies better?
