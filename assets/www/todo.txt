Gameplay:
    Don't scramble characters that are being displayed right now
    Don't let multiple characters sit on each other 64 width/height
    Animation of explosion when character is disappearing doesn't always show... when it starts to fade out

Secondary:
    High scores not sorted.
    Fix splash screen

Later:
    Main menu landscape / portrait messed up
       detect orientation change, reset the max/min container size in game?
